Bastien-Lepage, a native of Lorraine, depicts the moment when Saints Michael, Margaret, and Catherine appear to the peasant girl in her parents’ garden, rousing her to fight the English invaders in the Hundred Years War. Critics at the Salon of 1880 praised Bastien-Lepage’s use of pose and facial expression to convey Joan’s spiritual awakening, but found the inclusion of the saints at odds with his naturalistic style.",

She wears simple, worn clothes, with a loose blouse and skirt, blending her into the rural environment. Her expression is distant, almost transfixed, as she gazes slightly to the side, as if seeing something beyond the physical world. Behind her, faint, ghostly figures emerge: they are semi-transparent saints, only partially visible and seeming to hover, ethereal yet soft, in the natural surroundings. The background depicts a countryside scene with a modest wooden home, overgrown plants, and earthy tones that suggest a life of hard work and simplicity. Joan is bathed in a soft, natural light, which creates a warm, subtle glow around her, contrasting with the dimmer, more shadowed elements of the garden behind her. This combination of realistic details and faint, otherworldly apparitions brings an air of quiet mysticism, making Joan appear as a young, humble figure caught in a moment of divine revelation."

Joan of Arc, a 15th-century French heroine, claimed to have been divinely inspired to lead France during the Hundred Years' War. At the time of the painting, Joan was a national symbol of courage and patriotism for France, especially as the country sought to reclaim its identity after losses in the Franco-Prussian War.",
                "symbolic_meaning": "In *Joan of Arc*, the ghostly figures of saints behind Joan symbolize her spiritual calling and divine inspiration, while the humble garden setting reflects her modest peasant origins. This contrast between earthly life and divine purpose illustrates the tension in Joan's journey—a young, ordinary girl chosen for an extraordinary destiny. The warm light around Joan suggests a guiding presence, making her appear as a bridge between the natural and the supernatural realms.",

Repin made several portraits in this decade of artists in his orbit in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The rich tonal contrasts and lush brushwork are indebted to art he saw while studying in Paris. Four years after this picture was painted, Garshin, scarred by the suicides of his father and brother and his own mental illness, threw himself down a stairwell and died. Painted in 1884, this work reflects Repin’s ability to portray complex psychological states, a skill that contributed to his reputation as one of Russia’s foremost portraitists.

Krohg painted this working couple at Skagen, a village on the coast of Jutland in Denmark that hosted an influential artists’ colony, in the summer of 1879. His models were the fisherman Niels Christian Gaihede (1816–1890) and his wife, Ane Gaihede (1812–1904). Renouncing the sentimentality associated with peasant subjects then current in Nordic art, Krohg gave vent to an insistent objectivity that struck contemporaries as idiosyncratic to a fault when this work was exhibited in Oslo soon after it was completed. This criticism prompted Krohg to paint a more restrained version (National Museum, Oslo).",

He painted everyday subjects drawn from his local landscape in southwest Holland. This work depicts one of Mauve’s favorite and most popular subjects, a shepherd and his flock. Prices varied depending on whether the picture featured sheep coming, or, as here, the slightly less expensive sheep going. Vincent van Gogh, who was the cousin of Mauve’s wife, studied with Mauve in the winter of 1881–82, and admired him as a great interpreter of the fine gray Dutch countryside. This painting depicts a shepherd guiding his flock back home at dusk, capturing the quiet and contemplative atmosphere of rural life. Mauve’s soft brushwork and muted color palette emphasize the peaceful transition from day to night.",

Here, the humdrum activity of peeling potatoes is vivified by the girls’ bright red dresses and gleaming red-gold and blond hair. Their downcast eyes and serene expressions recall representations of the young Virgin Mary in sixteenth-century Flemish art, which Frederic greatly admired. Nothing is known of the sitters beyond the painting’s title, which identifies them as sisters; the two eldest are so uncannily alike that they appear to be twins.",

A lover of the poet Max Jacob, she may also have had a liaison with Picasso. Picasso painted this work over a landscape signed by a painter named González, presumably Joan González, the older brother of the sculptor Julio González. Created in 1903 during Picasso’s Blue Period, this portrait reflects the artist’s fascination with emotional depth and human suffering. Influenced by poverty and social issues, Picasso’s Blue Period works often depict somber expressions and monochromatic colors.",

The painting captures a quiet, intimate moment as she gazes thoughtfully at something in her hands, partially obscured by the flowers. The background is richly textured and filled with warm, earthy tones of red and brown, contrasting with the brighter yellow of the mimosa and the pale tabletop. Bonnard uses loose, expressive brushstrokes and a soft, almost hazy quality, typical of his Post-Impressionist style, to convey the scene's emotional atmosphere. The flowers appear to be slightly wilting, suggesting themes of fleeting beauty and introspection. The woman’s face is partially in shadow, lending her an air of mystery and introspection. Overall, the composition emphasizes warmth, contemplation, and the passage of time, creating a sense of intimacy and subtle melancholy. ",

He worked in a naturalistic figurative style and from it developed an art that was polemical in intent, uncanny in effect, and often controversial in reception. Klinger created Galatea at the height of his artistic fame when he was celebrated in German speaking countries as one of their greatest sculptors. He was best known for his complex polychrome sculptures that were assembled from assorted colored marbles and bronze. The mythical sea-goddess and child seated on a marble throne is Klinger’s only independent figurative sculpture in silver. In 1906 Klinger presented Galatea as his principle work at the prestigious exhibition of German contemporary art in Weimar. Shown in triumph, Klinger’s figure of the sea-goddess Galatea resonates with the primal aura of an idol. The subject was familiar to Klinger’s contemporaries from Goethe’s famous description of triumphant Galatea, Grave in aspect like the gods, in dignified immortality… (Faust II, 8387-90). But Klinger also drew from the contemporary philosophy of Nietzsche and Freudian psychology to create an unprecedented depiction of the goddess enthroned with a male child who together represent the archetypal union between body and mind, female and male, sexuality and the psyche.",

For this portrait, commissioned by her husband, the industrialist August Lederer, Klimt employed soft, sinuous brushstrokes to present Serena as an apparition in white. An upright flower, long-stemmed … like a black tulip, enthused one critic when the painting was shown in 1901 at the tenth exhibition of the Vienna Secession—a group founded by Klimt and other artists four years earlier, with the aim of putting the city at the forefront of the international art world. The Lederers subsequently formed the finest collection of Klimt’s work in private hands.",

During this time, Minne was preoccupied with the expressive motif of the kneeling figure, which evolved from his St. John the Baptist (1895) – a composition that captures the essence of Minne’s lifelong engagement with the religious spirituality of the Middle Ages – towards the isolated figure of a kneeling, introverted youth. The Small Kneeling Youth registers Minne’s pivotal transition from an earlier, expressive style, inspired by late-gothic woodcarving, to his mature, avant-garde style of elongated forms enhanced by sharp lines, taut surfaces, and gentle curves. Upright but shuddering beneath the enigmatic burden of his sorrow, this youth symbolizes the ambivalent condition of the human spirit in crisis at the dawn of the modern age.",

The picture testifies to the sophisticated taste of her parents, banker and industrialist Otto Primavesi and his wife Eugenia, who were ardent supporters of progressive Viennese art and design. In fact, Klimt soon painted Eugenia’s portrait (Toyota Municipal Museum of Art, Japan).",

By showing his left hand raised as if painting, the right-handed artist makes plain that he created his self-portrait by observing his reflection in a mirror. The sunlit door and window are two of the signature motifs that defined Hammershøi’s celebrated interior scenes. The reworked contours of the figure and the mauve underpaint visible in the face attest to the experimental spirit and bold handling that he cultivated in his late self-portraits.",
